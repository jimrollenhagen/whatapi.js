Do whatever you like with this module.
I'll probably add some BSD-style license soon.

The only things expressly forbidden by this license are:
1. You may not use this module for evil.
2. You may not use this module to violate what.cd rules.
3. You should limit requests to what.cd to a reasonable amount,
    e.g. 1 request per two seconds.
